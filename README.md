# Knight's Travails

## 📌 Overview
**Knight's Travails** is an interactive application that calculates and animates the shortest path a chess knight takes on an 8×8 board using the Breadth‑First Search (BFS) algorithm. Explore how a knight can reach any square from any starting point using minimal moves—all without building an explicit graph.

## ⚡ Features
- **Shortest Path with BFS:** Effectively finds the minimum moves required.
- **Interactive Drag & Drop:** Set start and end positions via a user-friendly interface.
- **Smooth Animation:** Watch the knight traverse the computed path with real-time move updates.
- **Reset Capability:** Easily restart your experiment with one click.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML & CSS**
- **BFS Graph Traversal** (utilizing an implicit graph representation)

## 🎯 What I Learned
- **BFS vs. DFS:** BFS is optimal for finding the shortest path as it explores moves level by level.
- **Implicit Graph Modeling:** Representing a chessboard as a graph on-the-fly, without creating an entire explicit structure.
- **Interactive UI Techniques:** Integrating drag‑and‑drop mechanics with algorithmic logic for an engaging user experience.
- **Algorithm Complexity:** Appreciating how a small, 8×8 board yields efficient performance and manageable space complexity.

## 💡 Try It Yourself
- **Step 1:** Drag the knight to your desired start cell and click **Lock Start**.
- **Step 2:** Click on any cell to select the end location.
- **Step 3:** Click **Run** to animate the knight along the BFS-computed shortest path while the move count updates in real time.
- **Reset:** Use the **Reset** button to clear the selections and start over.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- **Enhanced Animations:** Smoother motion and additional visual cues.
- **Tutorial Mode:** Detailed breakdown of the BFS process.
- **Algorithm Comparisons:** Analyzing BFS performance over larger boards.
